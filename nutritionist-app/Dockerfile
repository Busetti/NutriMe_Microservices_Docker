#### Stage 1: Build the angular application
FROM node as build
 
# Configure the main working directory inside the docker image. 
# This is the base directory used in any further RUN, COPY, and ENTRYPOINT 
# commands.
WORKDIR /app
 
# Copy the package.json as well as the package-lock.json and install 
# the dependencies. This is a separate step so the dependencies 
# will be cached unless changes to one of those two files 
# are made.
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
 
# Copy the main application
COPY . ./
 
# Arguments
ARG configuration=production
 
# Build the application
RUN npm run build -- --outputPath=./dist/out --configuration $configuration
 
#### Stage 2, use the compiled app, ready for production with Nginx
FROM nginx
 
# Copy the angular build from Stage 1
COPY --from=build /app/dist/out/ /usr/share/nginx/html
 
# Copy our custom nginx config
COPY /nginx-custom.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
 
 
# Expose port 80 to the Docker host, so we can access it 
# from the outside.
EXPOSE 80
 
ENTRYPOINT ["nginx","-g","daemon off;"]
